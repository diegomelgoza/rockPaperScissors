# rockPaperScissors

This project is following the instructions from The Odin Project.

## game.html
This is the very first version of the rock paper scissors game where the user is prompted
to enter their choice 5 times and each result can be viewed in the console. At the end of 5 rounds 
an alert pops up on the page displaying the final result. 

## rps files and style
This is the 'Final' version of rock paper scissors. Here instead of using alerts on the browser we instead display
everything on the web page. I decided to split the html, css, and javascript file although it was not asked of us in the project.
